Description:

Area 51, also referred to as SITE-██, is a concealed facility operated by the Foundation. To the untrained eye, it appears to be an ordinary military base, but its true nature lies beneath the surface. Deep underground, an elevator descends into the real foundation and advanced research labs studying extraordinary anomalies, and taking them away from the prying eyes of the outside world for the safety of the civilians.
