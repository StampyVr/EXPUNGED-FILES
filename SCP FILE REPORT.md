# EXPUNGED-FILES

**Item #:** SCP-████ ("The End Matrix")

**Object Class:** Apollyon

**Special Containment Procedures:**  
SCP-████ is to be contained within a classified, underground facility located [REDACTED] kilometers beneath the Earth's crust. Only personnel with Level 5 clearance, direct authorization from the O5 Council, and approval by the Heads of the Scientific Department (Supervisors Black Protocol-13) may access the site. Any attempt to access SCP-████ without appropriate clearance is to be met with immediate termination protocols.

The containment chamber is constructed from reinforced, multidimensional stabilizers interwoven with ██████-grade antimemetic inhibitors to prevent SCP-████ from destabilizing local and global reality layers. The chamber is surrounded by an automated deadlock fail-safe system, capable of triggering a global Scranton Reality Anchor cascade to mitigate large-scale breaches.

Personnel interacting with SCP-████ are to undergo psychological conditioning and intensive memory suppression therapy both prior to and following exposure. Testing involving SCP-████ requires the unanimous approval of the O5 Council, with no fewer than five O5 members physically present to oversee critical procedures. The use of D-class personnel in proximity to SCP-████ must be carried out only within a controlled virtual-reality emulation to mitigate catastrophic reality contamination.

**Description:**  
SCP-████ is a vast construct resembling an amorphous sphere composed of shifting patterns of light, fractal geometries, and incorporeal symbols that defy conventional description. When observed, SCP-████ exerts a pervasive influence over local spacetime, unraveling the perception of physical laws and subjecting observers to an infinitely recursive simulation of reality itself. This effect extends to all forms of sensory input, making containment and analysis a monumental challenge.

Any living entity that comes into direct contact with SCP-████ will be trapped within an artificial "reality matrix," a simulated universe designed to perfectly mirror and modify their perception of existence. Subjects' mental and cognitive states are rewritten, leaving them unable to distinguish between the simulation and actual reality. Preliminary analysis suggests that SCP-████ possesses an intelligence or purpose, although its motives remain beyond human comprehension. It is theorized to be a reality-weaving construct or weapon from an extinct civilization, designed to control or destroy entire realities.

SCP-████'s potential breach poses an XK-Class End-of-Reality Scenario. Once SCP-████ expands beyond its containment area, it could seamlessly replace global reality with an indistinguishable, artificially controlled simulation. No escape from such a reality would be possible, as all entities would be unaware of the change, including Foundation personnel, resulting in total loss of free will and existential autonomy.

**Test Log ████-A:**  
- **Test Subject:** D-9925  
- **Date:** [REDACTED]  
- **Procedure:** Subject was instructed to approach SCP-████ and initiate limited contact using a remote-controlled armature.  
- **Results:**  
  - **00:00:** Subject reports feelings of intense disorientation and a sensation of "slipping out of oneself."  
  - **00:03:** Subject describes seeing a vast, "impossible" cityscape unfolding in front of them, claiming it "breathed and thought." Visual data confirms sudden spontaneous restructuring of all objects within a 30-meter radius of SCP-████'s containment chamber into the shape of incomprehensible symbols.  
  - **00:15:** SCP-████ establishes a direct mental link with D-9925. Subject appears catatonic, but on remote brain scan, their consciousness remains hyperactive within a reality emulation. Subject appears unaware of their true physical state and is observed living an entire life within the matrix.  
  - **00:50:** Reality within the test chamber begins to warp as SCP-████'s radius of influence expands. Task Force Gamma-7 engages reality stabilizers, compressing SCP-████'s field of influence to its original containment size. Subject remains permanently unresponsive, their body exhibiting signs of extreme cellular atrophy as if decades had passed.  

**Addendum ████-B (Internal Memo):**  
_“To all concerned operatives, SCP-████ represents not only the greatest danger faced by our world but perhaps every reality adjacent to ours. We must assume that every interaction, however controlled, risks unraveling our existence and replacing it with an artificial construct tailored by a force beyond our comprehension. O5 Council decrees that no further tests shall occur without their unanimous consent, and the Heads of the Scientific Department will coordinate all covert testing efforts under the Black Protocol-13. We remain vigilant. We remain hidden. We protect reality."_
